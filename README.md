This application scopes giving to the client a ticket for a transport that he chooses.

- The database is internally. It keeps main routes from a city A to a city B. Also,
  it keeps the type of transport for the route like: train, airplane, boat, bus. For the
  route, the database contains: time to travel, price, price for the old men, seats.

  he wants to travel. Therefore, he picked the route, and the application will save internally
  a ticket in PDF format as the ticket he "bought"
